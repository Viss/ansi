IBM Extended Character Set & ANSI in HTML & Canvas

I initially started writing this in 2009 out of boredom and to get better aquainted with Javascript, Canvas, and the technologies
of my youth that I never had the attention span or resources to learn back then.

TODO:

- Support for non-9x16 characters (amiga? 80x50?)
- High resolution 'VGA' mode ala aciddraw
- Configurable color palettes
- iCE color support
