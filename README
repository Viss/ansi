IBM Extended Character Set & ANSI in HTML & Canvas

I started writing this in 2009 out of boredom and to get better aquainted with Javascript, Canvas, and the technologies
of my youth that I never had the attention span or resources to learn back then.

I let this languish for a year or two. It's really bad code. Maybe throwing it on github will motivate me to rewrite it now
that I don't suck at Javascript as much as I used to.

TODO:

- Rewrite into something slightly less shameful (in progress!)
<del>- Better way to define character sets</del>
- Support for non-9x16 characters (amiga? 80x50?)
- High resolution 'VGA' mode ala aciddraw
- >16 color support, pallete support
- Load in remote files
